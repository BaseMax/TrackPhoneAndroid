# Notification Listener

# Track Phone Android

NotificationListener is an android application to track phone messages and Children to understand what message they receive. (using Java)

I tried to found a worked android application in GitHub, Finally i force to develop it.

Some of that wont works, But i release a new version something works great with new technology of Android.

## Phone tracking

Some kids are smart and code on their phone. And they don't allow parents access to their phone.

At this time, some programs allow multiple people to sign in at the same time.
For example: Telegram
But sometimes kids are smart enough to realize that.

However, the best way to keep track of your child's activities is to control them remotely but accurately.

Hope this is helpful to you.
